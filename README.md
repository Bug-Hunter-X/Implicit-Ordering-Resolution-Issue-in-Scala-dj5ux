This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with implicit Ordering instances in Scala.  The provided code showcases a scenario where the code compiles and functions correctly with built-in types like Int and String due to the existence of default implicit Ordering instances. However, using a custom type without defining a corresponding implicit Ordering leads to a compilation error.  The solution demonstrates how to resolve this error by providing a custom implicit Ordering for the custom type.
